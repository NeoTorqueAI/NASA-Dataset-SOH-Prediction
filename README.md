# NASA-Dataset-SOH-Prediction
Author - Yash Shandilya
Short Description:- ML project to predict Li-ion battery State of Health (SOH) and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) using NASAâ€™s battery dataset. Includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, machine learning modeling, and result visualization. Aims to support predictive maintenance in EVs with interpretable ML insights.
# ðŸ”‹ Battery SOH & RUL Prediction Using ML (NASA Dataset)

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict the **State of Health (SOH)** and **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of lithium-ion batteries using the publicly available NASA Prognostics battery dataset. The goal is to enable smart, interpretable battery health diagnostics for use in EVs and predictive maintenance systems.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- **Source**: [NASA Ames Prognostics Data Repository](https://www.nasa.gov/content/prognostics-center-of-excellence-data-set-repository)
- **Format**: Cycle-wise CSV logs of battery charge/discharge experiments  
- **Features**: Voltage, Current, Temperature, Capacity, Cycle number  
- **Target Variables**:
  - **SOH**: State of Health (% of rated capacity)
  - **RUL**: Remaining number of cycles until End-of-Life (EOL)
